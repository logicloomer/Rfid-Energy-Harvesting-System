# Rfid-Energy-Harvesting-System
In order to overcome the energy constraints of RFID devices, this project designs and simulates an RFID energy harvesting system using MATLAB Simulink. 
The simulation takes into account practical aspects such as signal strength and efficiency by simulating the behavior of RF harvesters, power management, and energy storage devices.
By capturing radio wave energy for passive RFID tags, RFID energy harvesting provides an economical and environmentally friendly alternative to batteries for low-power applications. 
 The goal of this work is to create an RFID circuit that accepts input as a low radio wave with a 600-mV input wave and generates a voltage of 1-4 V that is enough for smart appliances.
